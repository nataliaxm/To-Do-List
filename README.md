# To-Do-List
# Chore List
# This project allows users to create a chore list and edit that list. There is a menu of options that the user can select from when creating their chore list.
# I used python lists to help me create this code.
# To use this project, you can input a number based on what you want to do to the chore list. After that, you can answer the question asked, and the program will perform the action. To see the list you have made, you can enter 2 on the menu. 
# Dallas helped me with this project.
